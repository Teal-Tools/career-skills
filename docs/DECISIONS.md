# Decisions

A running log of what's **locked** and what's still **open**. When you resolve an open
decision, move it up to Locked with a date and a one-line rationale.

## Locked

- **Org / namespace:** `Teal-Tools/career-skills`. Public. MIT. Presented as an
  official Teal open-source project (matches the org's existing public repo).
- **Repo name:** `career-skills` for discovery. "Thriving" / four-mode language is the
  *narrative* in README and marketing, not the repo name.
- **Architecture:** hybrid — discrete, individually-installable skills unified by the
  `career-profile` shared-context document. Installable à la carte or as one plugin.
- **Foundation:** `career-profile` is built first; every skill reads it; it absorbs the
  "capabilities dump" idea as its deep-interview path.
- **Compatibility:** author once against the LCD skill spec (`name`+`description`
  frontmatter); canonical `AGENTS.md`; thin per-CLI wrappers; symlink `skills/` into
  each CLI dir (fallback: sync script). Targets: Claude Code, Cowork, Codex, OpenClaw,
  Hermes.
- **MCP posture:** Teal MCP is an *enhancement layer*, never a hard dependency. Every
  skill works standalone with pasted data.
- **Resolution rule:** one skill = one JTBD + one deliverable. `resume-review` and
  `tailor-to-job` kept separate but share the rubric. `comp-analysis` and
  `skills-market-report` kept separate but share `teal-mcp.md`. `earn-more-plan` is
  separate because it compares multiple money trajectories in one interactive report.
- **Positioning:** cover Searching competently; **lead with Growing + Thriving**. Do
  not try to out-job-search career-ops. Stay light — no dashboard, no scanners.
- **GTM:** repo is top-of-funnel for the MCP and Teal; each skill is its own
  LinkedIn/YouTube artifact; light Teal footer on each skill.
- **Versioning/install:** semver + rename map in VERSIONS.md; install via
  `npx skills add`, plugin marketplace, and git clone.
- **Thriving ships in v1:** decided 2026-07-05. Ship at least `win-log` and
  `career-checkin` in v1 so the four-mode story is real at launch, not a promise.
- **Symlink vs. sync script:** decided 2026-07-05 — symlinks (`.claude/skills` and
  `.agents/skills` → `skills/`) are the default; `scripts/sync.mjs` mirrors
  (copies) `skills/` into each target instead, for Windows/CI/zip flows where
  symlinks are fragile. Same strategy either way, per CLAUDE.md §6.
- **All skills built:** as of 2026-07-05, every skill in the inventory has a full
  `SKILL.md` (no remaining `[SPEC]` stubs). 2026-07-10: `teal-mcp` (MCP setup +
  verification) added as skill #16; **v0.1.0 tagged** — see `VERSIONS.md`.
- **Plugin-marketplace schema (resolved 2026-07-09):** `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
  verified against the official plugin-marketplace docs — schema-valid as-is; the spec
  **auto-discovers `skills/` from the plugin root** and does not want skills enumerated
  in the manifest, so "list the shipped skills" was a non-requirement. Optional
  polish (a `plugin.json`, `homepage`/`license` fields, a `renames` map) noted for
  later.
- **Teal methodology pulled in (2026-07-06):** the skills now carry Teal's actual
  frameworks rather than placeholder stand-ins. `references/teal-method.md` is the
  **Achievement Formula** (Skill + Proof; Proof = Metric + Outcome; bullet = Success
  Verb + Noun/Keyword + Metric + Outcome) — the earlier invented "Task/Execution/
  Amplifier/Lift" draft is gone. `skills/career-profile/profile-schema.md` is locked
  (no `[SPEC]`) around Teal's self-discovery outputs (Work Style, Values → Motivation
  → Vision, Skills Matrix, Blurb). Comp/offer use Total Comp = 5 forms; resume/JD use
  the Achievement Formula + Job Posting Analysis; self-discovery uses Work Style /
  Values / Skills Matrix / 4 G's; interview/network/growth carry the 5 hiring stages,
  the +2/+7/+14 cadence, Career Health, and the shift-difficulty ladder. See
  `docs/TEAL-INPUT-AUDIT.md` (internal — do not publish) for the source mapping.

- **Description cap is 200 chars (decided 2026-07-16):** claude.ai's skill upload
  caps frontmatter `description` at 200 chars — tighter than the agentskills.io
  spec's 1024 and the binding constraint across target platforms (OpenClaw
  recommends <160, Hermes ≤60). All 16 descriptions rewritten to ≤200;
  `scripts/validate.mjs` errors and `scripts/package.mjs` warns above 200.
- **Rubric extracted to references/ (2026-07-16):** the canonical resume rubric now
  lives in `references/resume-rubric.md` and calibration in
  `references/resume-calibration.md` (moved from `skills/resume-review/`), so
  standalone installs of `tailor-to-job` carry the full rubric + bands —
  `package.mjs` vendors `references/*.md` into each zip. `resume-review` remains the
  rubric's home skill; neither skill redefines a band.
- **Ephemeral-runtime persistence (2026-07-16):** every `.agents/*.md`-writing skill
  now carries a "Persistence check" guardrail (and `profile-schema.md` an
  "Ephemeral runtimes" note): in sandboxed environments (claude.ai / Claude Desktop
  uploads), deliver the file's full contents in chat and have the user save and
  re-paste it, since writes don't survive the session.

## Open (resolve before v1 ships)

1. **`resume-review` / `tailor-to-job` final merge call?** Recommendation: keep
   separate, share rubric. Revisit only if behavior converges.
2. **Cross-CLI compatibility spike (§6) not yet run.** README claims the library
   "runs on" Claude Code, Cowork, Codex, OpenClaw, and Hermes, but the symlink-vs-sync
   spike has not been executed on those targets or on Windows. Verify before making the
   five-CLI claim publicly.
3. **Unverified Teal MCP tool suites.** Skills and footers reference `resume-*`,
   `tracker-jobs-*`, and "Teal CRM" MCP tools that `references/teal-mcp.md` names but
   does not document. Resolution path exists: run the `teal-mcp` skill with a real
   Teal login — its verify step lists the live tools and reconciles them against the
   reference. Until then, confirm they exist or soften the capability promises.
4. **`docs/TEAL-INPUT-AUDIT.md` history scrub.** Untracked and gitignored as of
   2026-07-16 (removed from the index going forward), but it still exists in
   unpushed local commits. Before the first public push, rewrite those local
   commits to drop it (`git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached
   --ignore-unmatch docs/TEAL-INPUT-AUDIT.md' -- origin/main..main`, then re-point
   the `v0.1.0` tag) — or explicitly bless the file as publishable.
